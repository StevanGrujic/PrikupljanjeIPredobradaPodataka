### Project Overview

This project focuses on addressing the issue of missing data, a common problem in data analysis that can lead to inaccurate conclusions and decision-making. The document discusses various methods for handling missing data, both conventional and modern, and evaluates their effectiveness. The practical component of the project applies these methods to a real dataset and compares their performance.

### Introduction

The problem of missing data arises when certain information is unavailable in a dataset due to various reasons such as data collection errors, refusal of participants to answer questions, or technical issues. Missing data can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of data analysis, leading to information loss, incorrect conclusions, and misinterpretation of results.

### Types of Missing Data

- **MCAR (Missing Completely At Random):** The probability of missing data is independent of the observed and unobserved data.
- **MAR (Missing At Random):** The probability of missing data is related to the observed data but not the unobserved data.
- **MNAR (Missing Not At Random):** The probability of missing data is related to the unobserved data itself.

### Conventional Methods for Handling Missing Data

1. **Listwise Deletion:** This method involves removing any cases with missing data, which can lead to a significant reduction in sample size and loss of information.
2. **Single Imputation Methods:**
   - **Mean Substitution:** Replacing missing data with the mean of the observed values.
   - **Random Imputation:** Imputing missing data randomly based on similar cases.
   - **Regression Imputation:** Using regression models to predict and fill in missing values.
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation:** Imputing missing values based on the closest cases in the dataset.

### Multiple Imputation

Multiple Imputation (MI) is a more sophisticated approach that involves generating multiple complete datasets by imputing missing values multiple times. The analysis is then performed on each dataset, and the results are combined to produce final estimates that account for the uncertainty in the imputation process. The MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) technique is highlighted as a flexible and widely used method for handling missing data.

### Machine Learning Models Resistant to Missing Data

Some machine learning models can inherently handle missing data, such as:
- **Random Forest:** Uses surrogate splits to handle missing values during the decision-making process.
- **Naive Bayes:** Can ignore missing values in the calculation of conditional probabilities.

### Practical Application

The practical part of the project involved testing different imputation methods on a dataset concerning the quality of drinking water. The dataset included chemical properties and an indicator of whether the water was suitable for consumption. Various imputation methods were compared, including MICE, KNN, mean substitution, and deletion of missing values.

The findings indicated that deleting missing values resulted in the best model performance, which was unexpected but likely due to the small size of the dataset. The Random Forest model was identified as the most effective for this particular dataset, showing that even with imputed data, some models can perform well.

### Conclusion

The project concludes that while there are many methods to handle missing data, the choice of method depends on various factors such as the type of data, the amount of missing data, and the goals of the analysis. Multiple Imputation, especially the MICE technique, is recommended for complex datasets, whereas simpler methods may suffice for smaller datasets. It is crucial to carefully consider the trade-offs between different methods to ensure the validity and reliability of the analysis.

### Recommendations

- **Method Selection:** Choose the imputation method based on the nature of the data and the analysis goals. For small datasets with a low percentage of missing data, simpler methods like deletion may be sufficient.
- **Model Choice:** Consider using machine learning models that can handle missing data natively, such as Random Forest or Naive Bayes, especially when dealing with complex datasets.
- **Validation:** Always validate the results after imputation to ensure that the chosen method does not introduce bias or distort the data's distribution.
